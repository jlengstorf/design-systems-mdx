import Button from "../components/button"

export const scope = { Button }

# Hi, this is a page.

Look at our sweet button!

```jsx react-live
<Button />
```

Lookit with props!

```jsx react-live
<Button text="Thanks Chris!" />
```

Don't touch this:

```jsx
<Button text="Yay!" />
```

Isnâ€™t that great?!
